Version 1.0-5

* New vignette describing package

* Fixed accidental multiple additions of .importDefaults()
  when useDefaults was called more than once on an object


Version 1.0-4

* Documentation now is spread out over multiple
  files.

* Fixed bug where if unDefaults was called on
  a function defined in the Global environment
  with importDefaults it would delete the function
  This _shouldn't_ happen.

* Fixed setDefaults problem where if a value was
  set to NULL by the caller, it was removed from
  the list of Defaults, and became impossible
  to reset to a new value

* Positional matching of args even if Default is set
  Also can now use partial matching for arguments to
  override the global Defaults from the fun call.

TO ADD:

* Partial matching of args would be nice during
  setDefaults

* Warning when a value is NOT set by setDefaults,
  because it _isn't_ a formal default, or because
  of a misspelling/partial name error.
